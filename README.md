1. **Survival Rate** (days lasted / 26) - Primary predictor across all metrics
2. **Total Challenges** - Challenge exposure more important than wins
3. **Tribals Attended** - Tribal council navigation ability
4. **Votes Per Tribal** - Threat management and target avoidance
5. **Individual Challenge Phase** - Post-merge individual game performance

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-target prediction** (placement, merge likelihood, finale likelihood, winner probability)
- **Advanced feature engineering** (win rates, strategic metrics, demographic analysis)
- **Comprehensive model evaluation** (ROC curves, confusion matrices, feature importance)

## 📈 Usage

### Quick Prediction
```python
from src.survivor_predictor import SurvivorPredictor

# Load trained models
predictor = SurvivorPredictor()

# Predict contestant success
contestant = {
    'Age': 28,
    'Gender': 'M',
    'Occupation': 'Software Engineer',
    'Strategic_Archetype': 'Strategic_Player',
    'Self_Reported_Fitness': 4,
    'Survivor_Knowledge': 'Superfan',

## 📊 Data Source

**Dataset:** 144 contestants from Survivor seasons 41-48 (New Era format)
- **Time Period:** 2021-2024
- **Format:** 26-day seasons filmed in Fiji
- **Features:** 35 original attributes per contestant
- **Success Metrics:** Placement, merge status, finale status, days lasted

**Key Features Include:**
- Demographics (age, gender, occupation, location)
- Physical attributes (fitness level, athletic background, build)
- Strategic profile (archetype, Survivor knowledge, target size)
- Performance metrics (challenge wins, alliance counts, votes received)

## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- **Feature Engineering:** Created 223 features from 35 original attributes
- **Derived Metrics:** Win rates, efficiency scores, strategic groupings
- **Encoding:** One-hot encoding for categoricals, standardization for numericals
- **Validation:** 5-fold cross-validation with stratified sampling

### Model Selection
- **Algorithms:** Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Linear Regression
- **Optimization:** RandomizedSearchCV with 50 parameter combinations
- **Evaluation:** Multiple metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, R², RMSE)
- **Ensemble:** Best-performing algorithm selected per prediction task

### Feature Importance Analysis
- **Method:** SHAP values and built-in feature importance
- **Categories:** Challenge performance, demographics, strategic gameplay, background
- **Insights:** Challenge exposure and survival rate dominate predictions

## 🎯 Model Insights

### Surprising Discoveries
- **Challenge quantity matters more than quality** - Total challenges faced predicts success better than win rates
- **Age has minimal impact** - Contrary to popular belief, age shows low predictive power
- **Strategic archetype less important** - Gameplay execution matters more than pre-game strategy
- **Superfan knowledge provides modest advantage** - Game knowledge helps but isn't decisive

### Success Formula
The models identified this pattern for Survivor success:
1. **Survive to face many challenges** (exposure indicates longevity)
2. **Manage threat perception** (low votes-per-tribal ratio)
3. **Navigate tribal councils effectively** (high tribals attended)
4. **Perform in individual immunity** (post-merge game crucial)

## 📋 Future Enhancements

- **Season 49+ Integration:** Automated pipeline for new contestant data
- **Web Interface:** Streamlit dashboard for interactive predictions
- **Real-time Updates:** Model retraining as episodes air
- **Advanced Analytics:** Player archetype clustering and similarity analysis
- **Confidence Intervals:** Bayesian approaches for prediction uncertainty
